                p1="This multi-functional living and dining space uses a muted colour palette to promote a calming atmosphere. The use of neutral tones paired with sage greens and soft blues will offer a clean look with added character through a pop of colours. Layering textures such as cotton or linen creates a dimensional look within the neutral colour palette. A textural scheme helps to elevate cosiness and makes sure it feels homely and relaxing, while lightweight fabrics will keep things neutral and fresh."
                p2="A home without plants just isn't a home. They bring freshness to any scheme and have countless health benefits such as reducing stress and uplifting your mood - perfect for a relaxing environment. Washed oak furniture features highly in the design to promote brightness but also introduce warmth and balance the neutral tones. The cohesion between wooden textures in the two spaces is important to offer a seamless flow throughout the room."
