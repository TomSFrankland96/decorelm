                p1="For this living room and dining space, a combination of Coastal and Scandinavian interior styles bring a light and airy feel to the space by using soft materials and calming tones. The soothing colours of sage green and pale blue achieve a peaceful feel to the room, the perfect place to relax. Combining some Scandinavian elements with the Coastal style perfectly ties the look together and allow some warmer tones to bring character and dimension. Subtle, oak textures are frequently repeated in Scandinavian interiors which nicely compliments the soothing colour palette. "
                p2="The key to creating this light and airy feel is to use neutral colours and textures for the main furniture items (e.g. sofa, rugs and tables) then introduce colour through the styling (e.g. cushions, plants and decor accessories) to create balance and cohesion within the open-plan living area. In turn, this has created a truly dimensional look with character and interest."
